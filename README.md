- 👋 Hi, I’m @Fede6t
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about the vast world of coding. I haven´t decided what type of programmer I want to be yet
        but I'm keen on finding out along the way.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python 3, in the stage of learning how to make my firsts proyects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new proyects on my own, as a way to discover both what I´m really interested in and 
        new opportunities to make a living out of all this knowledge, while also facing new challenges everyday.
