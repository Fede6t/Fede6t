### Hi there!

Hi, my name is Federico Tsushima, I´m 23 years old and I´ve been recently introduced to the world of programming. I'm currently learning Python 3 with the Udemy course 'The complete Python developer' by Andrei Neagoie and I´m very excited to learn many other things as well. I currently haven't decided which career I want to follow but I know I will make that decision along the way of completing this, and many other programming courses.
